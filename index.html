	<h1>Love is...</h1>

	<p>“Since There’s No Help,” by Michael Drayton (1563-1631)</p>

	It may be a bad augury to begin
	with a poem by a loser, but there 
	it is. Drayton, a contemporary 
	and possible acquaintance of the 
	Bard, evidently had come to the 
	unhappy end of an affair when he 
	penned this sonnet.  He begins 
	with a show of stoic indifference:
	“. . . you get no more of me,” but
	that can’t last. In the last six 
	lines he shows his true feelings 
	with a series of personifications 
	of the dying figures of Love, 
	Passion, Faith, and Innocence, 
	which he pleads can be saved 
	from their fate by the lady’s 
	kindness.

	<p style="text-align: right;">“How Do I Love Thee,” by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861)</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://classicalpoets.org/2016/10/27/10-greatest-love-poems-ever-written/">
	<pre style="font-family: Brush Script MT;font-size: 130%;text-align: right;">
	How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
	I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
	My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
 	For the ends of being and ideal grace.
	I love thee to the level of every day’s
	Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
	I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
	I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
	I love thee with the passion put to use
	In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
	I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
	With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
	Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
	I shall but love thee better after death.

	<p>“A Red, Red Rose,” by Robert Burns (1759-1796)</p>

	<blockquote cite="https://classicalpoets.org/2016/10/27/10-greatest-love-poems-ever-written/">
	<pre style="font-family: Brush Script MT;font-size: 200%;">
	O my Luve is like a red, red rose
	That’s newly sprung in June;
	O my Luve is like the melody
	That’s sweetly played in tune.

	So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
	So deep in luve am I;
	And I will luve thee still, my dear,
	Till a’ the seas gang dry.

	Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
	And the rocks melt wi’ the sun;
	I will love thee still, my dear,
	While the sands o’ life shall run.

	And fare thee weel, my only luve!
	And fare thee weel awhile!
	And I will come again, my luve,
	Though it were ten thousand mile.
